This is a work-in-progress but fully functional javascript NES emulator carefully written in the *ECMAScript 6* standard.

I've put a lot of efforts into writing beautiful, well organized and easy to understand code, and the same applies to the Git commits themselves. The repository, with its complete history, can be used for learning the step-by-step creation of a solo side-project using *Git*, *Node.js*, *Webpack*, *Babel*, *Mocha*, *Chai*, *ESLint*, and of course *Javascript* (currently writing a blog about all this).

#### Working :  
  ✓ CPU  
  ✓ PPU `(image)`  
  ✓ APU `(sound + music)`  
  ✓ Controllers `(only Keyboard for now)`  
  ✓ Games without mapper `(Ex.: Super Mario Bros.)`  
  Memory mappers: ✓ MMC1 `(Ex.: Tetris)`  
#### To do :  
  Memory mappers: *UNROM*, *CNROM*, *MMC3*, *MMC5*  
  *Debugger*  

Fully tested using [Mocha.js](http://mochajs.org/) + [Chai.js](http://chaijs.com/)

-----
*Unfortunately, I cannot provide the games for legal reasons, so you have to load your own `.NES` files.  
There are lots of places on the internet where you can get that...
